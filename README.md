The Ultimate English Poster (with Kannada) is a simple, bilingual learning website created to help students understand English grammar easily through clear Kannada translations. It covers all twelve tenses, modal verbs, and useful sentence examples that make grammar fun and visual. The website is built using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript, giving it a modern and responsive design. Each section includes color-coded examples and interactive buttons that generate new sentences to help learners practice. This project aims to make English learning accessible, enjoyable, and culturally familiar for Kannada-speaking learners.
